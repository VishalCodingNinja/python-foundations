**Learn Python from zero, one runnable example at a time.**

This repo holds everything from the *Python Foundations* live session on
[The Growth Club](https://www.youtube.com/@TheGrowthClubOfficial) YouTube channel:

- **30 runnable demos**, one for every example in the session
- **7 hands-on exercises**, each with a starter file and a worked solution
- **The full slide deck** as a PDF: [`slides/python-foundations-slides.pdf`](slides/python-foundations-slides.pdf)

## Who this is for

- Complete beginners who have never written a line of code
- Developers from another language who want a quick tour of Python
- Anyone who watched the session and wants the code to practise with

By the end you can store and convert data, make decisions, loop over lists, model data
with dictionaries and JSON, call a web API, write your own functions and classes, and
read, write and organise files safely.

## Quick start

**1. Install Python 3.10 or newer** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
On Windows, tick **"Add python.exe to PATH"** in the installer. Then check it:

```bash
python --version
```

**2. Get the code.** With Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VishalCodingNinja/python-foundations.git
```

```bash
cd python-foundations
```

No Git? Click the green **Code** button on this page, choose **Download ZIP** and unzip it.

**3. Run your first program:**

```bash
python hello.py
```

You should see `hello world`. Now try a real demo:

```bash
python 01_data_types_io/tax_calculator.py
```

> On macOS and Linux, type `python3` wherever this guide says `python`.

## How to follow along

1. **Watch** a module in the video, with the [slides](slides/python-foundations-slides.pdf) open.
2. **Run** that module's demos, then change the numbers and text to see what happens.
3. **Practise** with the module's exercise in [`exercises/`](exercises/).
4. **Compare** your answer with the matching file in [`solutions/`](solutions/).

Each exercise file starts with the task, a sample run and hints, followed by `TODO`
comments where your code goes. Try it yourself first, then check the solution.

## Weather API setup (Module 4)

Every demo runs with plain Python except
[`weather_api.py`](04_dicts_json_pip/weather_api.py), which needs the `requests`
package and a free API key.

**1. Create a virtual environment**, so packages stay inside this project:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

**2. Activate it.** Windows (PowerShell or Command Prompt):

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

macOS or Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Your prompt now starts with `(.venv)`.

**3. Install the packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Add your API key.** Create a free account at
[openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org) and copy your key. Set it in the same
terminal window: use `$env:OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "your-key"` in PowerShell,
`set OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-key` in Command Prompt, or
`export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-key` on macOS and Linux.

**5. Run it:**

```bash
python 04_dicts_json_pip/weather_api.py
```

> Keep your key out of the code and out of Git. The demo reads it from the environment
> for exactly that reason.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `python` is not recognized | Reinstall Python with **"Add python.exe to PATH"** ticked, or use `py` on Windows and `python3` on macOS/Linux. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'` | Activate the virtual environment, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. |
| PowerShell won't run `.venv\Scripts\activate` | Open Command Prompt instead and run `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`. |
| `ValueError: invalid literal for int()` | The program expected a whole number. Type digits only; Module 7 shows how to catch this error. |
| Weather demo returns error 401 | The API key is wrong or still new. Fresh OpenWeatherMap keys can take a couple of hours to start working. |
| A file demo created extra files | That's expected. The demos in `07_files_exceptions` only touch files they create (`list.txt`, `playground/`, `messy_folder/`). Delete them any time. |
